In my Freshman year I joined the Combat Robotics Club and made a slanted horizontal spinner. We differentiated our bot from the competition in two different ways, our chassis was made entirely from a single PETG print, and our spinner was slanted downward at a slight angle. The monoprint chassis reduced the assembly required and made it stronger, and the slanted weapon was an attempt to attack common wheel hights and attack horizontal undercutters pulleys. 

The chassis idea turned out to be a resounding success, however packaging, and the rigidty of the slanted weapon was terrible. We had to cantilever the weapon, which made it increadibly susceptibal to breaking. We also were using tiny o-rings for power transformation from the motor, to preseve to motor under weapon contact. This would have been great, except the o-rings were old and had lots of dry rot, so the weapon drive broke every single time it took contact. However because our chassis was so tough, we did win 1/3 of our fights just through outlasting the opponent. Here is the video of our one win:
