## Welcome to My Portfolio Website!
My name is Brady Hogg, and I am a mechanical Engineering student at Washington State University. This "Portfolio" is more of a place where I am able to really tell the story of who I am as an engineer, how I got there, and me sharing a lot of the cool things I have gotten to work on. I do apologize, it is not very concise, but I wanted to have a place to put all of this information.

See the following pages for specifics on the projects (roughly decending in chronological order):
- [Robosub of the Palouse](/robosub)
- [Exotic Metals Forming Division](/exotic)
- [Coug Shop CNC Machinst](/cougshop)
- [Crimson Combat Robotics](/crimson)
- [High School Robotics](/bearmetal)
