#FRC team 2046, [Bear Metal](https://tahomarobotics.org/)
## Introduction
I was on the FRC team at my high school, Bear Metal Robotics, for 3 years. FRC, or [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) is a high school program in which schools all over the world compete annually, to design, build and program a 115 lb robot, to compete in a 3 on 3 format. Participating in this was incredibly formative for me. I still will forever be in debt to all of the older students, mentors, and supporters of that team for giving me a life long passion for engineering.

I distinctly remember the moment I knew I was going to be an engineer. Before the real season
