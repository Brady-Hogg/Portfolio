# Introduction
The WSU AUV team, [Palouse Robosub](https://robosub.eecs.wsu.edu/), a team for [Robonation's Robosub Competition](https://robosub.org/), was pracitcally dead when I got to WSU. I remember the club consisted of 3 members, and they had not competed in any capacity since before COVID. COVID almost killed the club, and I am so glad those who were still there didn't let it die. We started off the first semester by desgining mini-submarines which never got built unfortunately, which is okay because my design was awful as I had no clue what I was doing, I had no guidiance and there were no mechanical engineers left over, besides a graduate student who would pop in every now and then. But I saw that the club had potential and I knew I had the experience and the determination needed to get the club back. And very importantly I was able to convince somebody else to tackle the challenge with me, my now very good friend, but then somewhat stranger, [Cole Wilson](https://cole.ws/). So now with Cole as President and computer science lead, myself as Vice President and Mechanical lead we were able to reorganize the club, and inspire many other key players in getting robosub back, [Natalie Masserenti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-massarenti2028/), [Colten Ladd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltenladd/), [Daniel Bereza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielbereza/) and many others. We are clawing our way back up, and are determined to compete with our new sub ***Guppy***.
# Reorganizing the club
This ranges from reorganizing the entire club room, writing a club constiution scratch, creating training resources, technical schedules, leadership structures, sponsor relations, and more all from scratch. Not to mention all of the work neccisary technically. 
# Guppy
Through lots of deliberation, our strategy for the 2027 season will eventually be to run two autonomous subs in tandem. This will be incredibly challeneging, but has serious strategical advantages. To get their, for 2026 we are making the first of the sister subs, Guppy. Like mentioned previously, Guppy is an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), not only is it autonomous in terms of its decision making it also has no tether back to shore. All power and data comes directly from within the sub. As it is still early in the design process as I write this, I only have the preliminary CAD model along with many other projects spread out amoung our members in infancy:


By late october 2025 we will have all of the frame and hull manufactured and assembled. By Feburary 2026 we will have all custom PCBs completed along with the torpedo and arm mechanism. And by August, come hell or high water, there will be a running AUV, in the pool, in San deigo, competing in Robosub 2026, proudly wearing the beautiful Washington State Cougar logo.
