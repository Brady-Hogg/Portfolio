# Introduction
As much as I would love to share what I did at Exotics Metals, I am under NDA as well as Exotic Metals participating in ITAR contracts, which most of my summer work involved. You'll just have to trust me that it was all super awesome and I did an excellent job. 
## What I can Tell You
My resume sums up pretty much everything I disclose:

"
- Interpreted drawings for F35 engine components in order to verify designs met all requirements.
- Investigated numerous quality non-conformances and created planning to solve the issues.
-	Prevented tens of thousands of dollars in prevented scrap with an inspection fixture.
-	Designed a TPU hand guard that fits into complex geometry to improve worker safety.
-	Created a tool to decrease the conductive cooling on a large part sensitive to warping.
-	Prevented machine downtime by designing a modification to the world’s 2nd largest hydroform press.
-	All designs were drafted to ASME Y14.5 GD&T and approved by the in-house tool and die shop."
